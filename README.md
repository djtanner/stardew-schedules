A React app to help you find the locations of Stardew Valley NPCs based on form inputs, using data from the [SDV Wiki](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/).

## Features

- Two main components: **Form** and **Schedule**
- Updating fields in the form after the first render will automatically update the schedule
- Schedules are available only for [Marriage Candidate Villagers](https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Villagers)

## Future Improvements

- Expand schedules to include the entire list of villagers
